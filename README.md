## Overview
Corellian Spike is gambling cardgame played with a deck of 62 cards, and 2 six-sided dice (2d6). The goal of the game is to win eveyone's money by having the best hand (one whose sum is 0, or as close to it as possible.) 
### The Cards
Every card has a numerical value, positive or negative, ranging from __-10__ to __+10.__ Positive cards are typically __green,__ and negative cards are typically __red.__
> _(Note: If you use normal earth playing cards, use __black__ cards for positive, and __red__ cards for negative. Use __Jokers__ for __Sylops__.)_

Every card has a Stave as well (__Triangle, Circle, Square,__ or __Sylop__), but only the only Stave that effects the gameplay is the __Sylop;__ the rest are interchangeable.

#### Distribution:

### The Spike Dice
Corellian Spike uses 2 identical 6-sided dice, usually with the following markings:
![Spike Dice template](https://github.com/Corellian-Spike/Corellian-Spike.github.io/blob/master/Sabacc/dice/spike%20dice%20template.png?raw=true "Spike Dice template")

The markings (like the card Staves) are primarily aesthetic, as the only time they effect the game is when doubles are rolled (i.e. when both dice land on the same symbol).

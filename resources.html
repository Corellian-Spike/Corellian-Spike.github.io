      <h2 id="deck">The Deck</h2>
      <p>
        There are 62 cards in a deck of Corellian Spike.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 30 positive and 30 negative cards, and 2 cards (called Sylops) that are worth 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical deck might look like this:

      </p>
      <p>
        A complete deck has three sets of 1 through 10, positive and negative.
        It also has two 0 cards, known as Sylops.

              The included rules come close to matching those
              used in <em>Solo</em>, but lack gambling mechanics. You may be able to find one for a decent
              price on eBay.

              These cards have the "Star Wars" logo on the back, and the rules
              don't quite match up to those used in the film. We have usually seen it available for 
              not more than $15 (USD).

              The cards look incredibly accurate, however they are only textured on one side, meaning they have a tendency to slide more than
              other cards do.

      <h2 id="dice">The Spike Dice</h2>
      <p>
        Corellian Spike uses two 6-sided dice (2d6) known as the "Spike Dice."
      </p>
      <p>
        On screen, the dice have alien markings rather than pips. For the sake of playing Corellian Spike however, the dice
        only matter when doubles are rolled, so understanding their meaning is not actually important. Nonetheless,
        this is our best guess for the numerical representations of the Spike Dice:
